										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come to me first? Only don’t tell me you’re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. My father’s name was Antonio Andolini… and this is for you.</p>



<p>Don’t you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Friends and money – oil and water. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I’ve always been loyal to you. Sonny, please don’t do anything. Please don’t do anything.</p>



<p>You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Don’t ever give an order like that again. Not while I’m alive. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!</p>



<p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I don’t like violence, Tom. I’m a businessman; blood is a big expense. I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.</p>



<p>It’s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don’t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I don’t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Hey, listen, I want somebody good – and I mean very good – to plant that gun. I don’t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?</p>
