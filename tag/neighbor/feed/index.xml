										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Do me this favor. I won\\\&#8217;t forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They\\\&#8217;ll tell you I know how to return a favor. I don\\\&#8217;t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. What\\\&#8217;s the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he\\\&#8217;s born? I\\\&#8217;m your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! What\\\&#8217;s the matter with you? Is this what you\\\&#8217;ve become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? \\\&#8221;Oh, what do I do? What do I do?\\\&#8221; What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!</p>



<p>Hey, listen, I want somebody good &#8211; and I mean very good &#8211; to plant that gun. I don\\\&#8217;t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Fredo, you\\\&#8217;re my older brother, and I love you. But don\\\&#8217;t ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.</p>



<p>The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I\\\&#8217;ve always been loyal to you. Only don\\\&#8217;t tell me you\\\&#8217;re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I don\\\&#8217;t like violence, Tom. I\\\&#8217;m a businessman; blood is a big expense.</p>



<p>I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let\\\&#8217;s work through where we go from here. It\\\&#8217;s an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. When they comeâ€¦ they come at what you love. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father\\\&#8217;s name? Friends and money &#8211; oil and water.</p>



<p>My father taught me many things here &#8211; he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.</p>
