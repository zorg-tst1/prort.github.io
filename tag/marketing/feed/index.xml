<p>Doubling my 9–5 salary several times in my career is something I never thought would happen. My career went from startup land to call center operator in a short space of time.</p>



<p>That meant going from six-figures down to the minimum wage in my home country of Australia. And to top it off, I have no degrees in anything business related — unless you count a sound engineering qualification.</p>



<p>If an uneducated guy from the home of the Kangaroo can double their salary, there is definitely hope for you. Popular career websites like “Seek” suggest the typical advice about doing better in your performance review or getting more education from a university. This advice is out of date and I have watched many colleagues fall for this trap and only end up disappointed.</p>



<p>Doubling your salary, or at the very least increasing it significantly, is about breaking the norm and trying a few things that are a bit more radical as you’re about to see with these simple tips below.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">The goal should be more than money</h4>



<p>Okay so you can make more money but if that’s your only goal, the extra zeroes on your bank balance will get really boring real quick.</p>



<blockquote class="\\\&quot;wp-block-quote\\\&quot; is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>You can develop side-businesses, side-hustles, and hobbies that can supplement your 9–5 income source, and they can all put extra money in your pocket that allows you to work less and not stress so much about bills.</p></blockquote>

<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come to me first? Only don’t tell me you’re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. My father’s name was Antonio Andolini… and this is for you.</p>



<p>Don’t you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Friends and money – oil and water. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I’ve always been loyal to you. Sonny, please don’t do anything. Please don’t do anything.</p>



<p>You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Don’t ever give an order like that again. Not while I’m alive. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!</p>



<p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I don’t like violence, Tom. I’m a businessman; blood is a big expense. I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.</p>



<p>It’s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don’t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I don’t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Hey, listen, I want somebody good – and I mean very good – to plant that gun. I don’t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?</p>
